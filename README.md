This F# library provides:

- A dedicated `Dict<'T>` type. It is a thin wrapper around `Dictionary<'T>` with more functionality and nicer Error messages.

- A `DefaultDict<'T>` type. It works like [Python's' defaultdict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict).<br>
By providing a default function in the constructor it will always return a value for any key.

- Extension methods for working with the `IDictionary<'T>` interface.

It also works in JS and TS with [Fable](https://fable.io/).

This library was designed for use with F# scripting.
Functions and methods never return null.
Only functions starting with `try...` will return an F# Option.
Otherwise when a function fails on invalid input it will throw a descriptive exception.

I was always annoyed that a KeyNotFoundExceptions does not include the actual bad key nor a pretty printed dictionary.
This library fixes that in `iDictionary.Get`, `iDictionary.Set` and other item access functions.

### Example

```fsharp
#r "nuget: Dicts"
open Dicts

let dd = DefaultDict<string,int>(fun _ -> ref 99)
incr dd.["A"]   // since dd.["A"] does not exist it will be created with the default value 99, and then incremented  to 100
incr dd.["A"]   // now it exists and will be incremented to 101
dd.["A"].Value  = 101 // true
```

### Tests
All Tests run in both javascript and dotnet.
Successful Fable compilation to typescript is verified too.
Go to the tests folder:

```bash
cd Tests
```

For testing with .NET using Expecto:

```bash
dotnet run
```

for JS testing with Fable.Mocha and TS verification:

```bash
npm test
```
